# Tutor Uberization Platform

A tutoring marketplace app that connects students/parents with verified tutors, similar to an “Uber-style” matching and booking flow.

## Problem
Finding trustworthy tutors is time-consuming and inconsistent (availability, pricing, quality, and verification vary). This project proposes a platform that helps students quickly find, compare, and book tutors.

## Key Features
- User accounts (Student / Parent / Tutor)
- Tutor profiles (subjects, pricing, location/online, availability)
- Search & filtering (subject, rating, price, availability)
- Booking & scheduling
- Ratings & reviews
- (Optional) Online session support / chat
- (Optional) Payments and receipts
